To construct an automaton that recognizes L_reverse out of an automaton A that recognizes L, there are a few steps. First, convert the initial state of A into an accepting state. Next, create an initial state with an epsilon-path to each of the accepting states of A (which become not-accepting states unless one of them was also the initial state). Then, reverse every arrow in each path that leads from A's initial state to any accepting state.

For example, view images/problem4A.jpg and images/problem4B.jpg for examples of an A automaton, and the resulting transformation.

problem4A represents an automaton that accepts any string that ends in 11, 101, or 001. problem4B represents an automaton that accepts any string that begins with 11, 101, or 100.
